The way this article described the wireframing process, it sounds a lot like the ideation and protypting 
process that design thinkers undergo when eiher improving an existing product or creating a new one.
The article states, "itâ€™s essential to gain more clarity about the issues in the problem in order to 
create a better solution." I certainly agree that involving the stakeholder in the process is imperative 
because the client knows best what they want their final product to look like so it is not only essentially 
but generally just smarter to get as much clarity from the stakeholder in order to be 100% clear on what 
the final wireframing outcome should be. The artcile also emphasizes early feedback, stating that it "helps 
incorporate and consider the technical limitations and other unforeseen capabilities." I think this goes 
hand in hand with the previous quote. Clarification and feedback is pretty much one of the most full-proof ways 
to avoid failure, and this applies not only to wireframing but to any project.
